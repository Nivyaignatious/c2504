QN6. print the N th term in the series 21, 22, 24, 27, 31, ... use do..while loop
Note: 
    21, 22, 24, 27, 31, ...
      1   2   3   4           diff    
    1. GetNthTerm_21_22_24_27 -> int, N -> int 
    2. TestGetNthTerm_21_22_24_27 -> void 
        N is number of terms 
----ps----
function GetNthTermOfSeries(N)    
    term = 21
    difference = 1
    I = 1
    do  
        if I == N
            break
        end if         
        //
        term = term + difference
        difference = difference + 1

        I++ 
    while  I <= N  
    return term
function TestGetNthTerm_21_22_24_27()
    Input N                             
    nthTerm = GetNthTermOfSeries(N)
    Print nthTerm
